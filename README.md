# My Readings

This repository is the source for a static site generator used to share the books I read.
Each book is rated and can be tagged as a favorite.
The content is displayed using a filterable, sortable, and paginated table.

There is also a dedicated section for recent readings for convenience.

The content is, most of the time, written using [**`[Mâ†“]`** Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and served by [`nanoc`](http://nanoc.ws/).

This website is available at https://lecture.opatry.net/ using [ðŸ”¥ Firebase hosting](https://firebase.google.com/products/hosting).

You can combine sorting across multiple columns using the <kbd>shift</kbd> key.

On the [last readings](https://lecture.opatry.net/last-readings.html) page, you can filter to display [only favorites](https://lecture.opatry.net/last-readings.html#only-favorites) (indicated by the heart on the right).

Alternatively, you can navigate by date using the calendar.

Finally, there is an [RSS feed](https://lecture.opatry.net/feed.xml) for those who still believe in it!

## ðŸ›  Requirements & Initial setup

```bash
$ gem install bundler
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec nanoc compile
```

This project also requires [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/) for resizing and automated processing pipelines. Initially, it seemed convenient, but now it feels a bit cumbersome due to the ongoing migration from ImageMagick 6 to 7.

To avoid compatibility issues (since version 7 changed command-line names and some parameter orders), Linux distributions remain conservative and stick with version 6. However, this is not the direction for the future.
On macOS, itâ€™s still possible to install version 6 (`brew install imagemagick@6`), but again, it may not be a viable long-term choice.

Version 7 was released around 2016 (see [`7.0.1-0`](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/releases/tag/7.0.1-0) tag or [releases archive](https://imagemagick.org/archive/releases/)).Now, in 2025, it has been decided to fully rely on version 7.
That said, there are still 6.x releases, but this version is considered legacy, which makes the projectâ€™s status feel somewhat awkward.

> The main website for ImageMagick can be found at [https://imagemagick.org](https://imagemagick.org). The most recent version available is 
> [ImageMagick 7.1.1-43](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php). The source code for this software can be accessed through a 
> [repository](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick). In addition, we maintain a legacy version of ImageMagick, 
> [version 6](https://legacy.imagemagick.org/). Read our [porting](https://imagemagick.org/script/porting.php) guide for comprehensive details
> on transitioning from version 6 to version 7.

```bash
$ brew install imagemagick@7
```

For Linux, follow the instructions to build from sources.
